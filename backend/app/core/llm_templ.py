    Threat Intelligence:
        Identify attack vectors, exploitation techniques,
        lateral movement strategies, and potential compromise indicators.
        Map the attacker's methodology, reconnaissance depth,
        and progression through the cyber kill chain stages.
    Mitigation Strategy:
        Comprehensive assessment of vulnerabilities exposed,

        threat neutralization, and preventive security hardening.
    RedTeam Recommendations (What is the better way to do it?):
        Craft advanced simulation scenarios based on discovered attack
        patterns. Develop targeted penetration testing protocols,
        validate detection mechanisms, and design custom exploit
        chains that mirror the observed threat landscape.
