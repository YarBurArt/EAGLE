    Analyze the JSON kill chain export. Detect and summarize:
    Threat Intelligence:
        Identify attack vectors, exploitation techniques,
        lateral movement strategies, and potential compromise indicators.
        Map the attacker's methodology, reconnaissance depth,
        and progression through the cyber kill chain stages.
    Mitigation Strategy:
        Comprehensive assessment of vulnerabilities exposed,
        critical infrastructure at risk, and recommended defensive
        countermeasures. Provide actionable insights for incident response,
        threat neutralization, and preventive security hardening.
    RedTeam Recommendations (What is the better way to do it?):
        Craft advanced simulation scenarios based on discovered attack
        patterns. Develop targeted penetration testing protocols,
        validate detection mechanisms, and design custom exploit
        chains that mirror the observed threat landscape.

        potential blind spots in current defensive architectures.
