# EAGLE Project Frontend Documentation

The EAGLE project frontend is a minimalist solution crafted to address specific operational requirements with strategic technological simplicity. Leveraging `JavaScript`, `jQuery`, and `Tailwind CSS`, our implementation focuses on core functionality beyond traditional interface development.

## Functional Scope

Our frontend enables critical operations:
- Command execution on agents and locally
- Launching execution chains
- Emergency chain interruption via `WebSocket`

> interrupting the chain does not work for the current step due to the specifics of its execution on the backend, cancels only the next one or after next step


## Technological Strategy

The current implementation serves as an experimental platform, bridging immediate project needs with future architectural aspirations. It represents a deliberate choice to maintain flexibility and prepare for eventual migration to `React` + integrated `Tailwind CSS` .

By prioritizing operational efficiency over comprehensive UI, we've created a lightweight interface that supports essential project interactions while providing a testing ground for innovative development approaches.
